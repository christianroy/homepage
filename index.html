          <h1>Correlation does not imply causation</h1>
          <p class="lead">Here's why and what you should know about it.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="container-narrow">
      
      <div class="row-fluid explanation">

        <p>It is a <strong>common misunderstanding</strong> to assume that one thing is the consequence of another because they happen together.</p>
        <p>People do it all the time.</p>

        <div class="row-fluid illustration">
          <div class="span6">
            <p>Sometimes, they don't do it on purpose, they just don't see the difference or make an error.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="span6">
            <p>Sometimes, they highlight correlation to falsely imply causation, which is simply dishonnest.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In any case, <strong>thinking that correlation implies causation is incorrect.</strong></p>
        <p>Let us be clear. Things <i>may</i> happen together because one is the consequence of the other. So, people are right when saying that correlation may be a hint of causation.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, one has to be careful and rigorous. A lot of things happen together, even though they do not cause each other. For example...</p>
        <div class="row-fluid illustration">
          <div class="span4">
            <p>example 1</p>
          </div>
          <div class="span4">
            <p>example 2</p>
          </div>
          <div class="span4">
            <p>example 3</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>So what?</strong></p>

        <p>Wellâ€¦ just keep that in mind and learn to detect and point at invalid reasoning like the one discussed here. It will be useful on a daily basis:
          <ul class="illustration">
            <li>Making sound arguments &mdash; explaining real cause to effect, not relying only on correlation &mdash; will make you more credible.</li>
            <li>Having the ability to detect false reasoning will help you be a better critic of what you hear and read.</li>
            <li>Helping people around you understand the above will enrich them and provide you a warm, fuzzy feeling of doing the Right thing.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>Let people around you know when you hear a weak argument based on correlation. Be a constructive critic, and help us make the world a better place.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>My name is Christian Roy. I wrote this when pissed off after hearing stupid arguments everywhere, especially on the radio. I decided that I would try something so that my three kids will not grow up in a world where people confound correlation and causation.</p>
