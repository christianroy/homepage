          <p class="lead">Here's why and what you should know about it.</p>

      <div class="row-fluid explanation">

        <p>It is a <strong>common misunderstanding</strong> to assume that one thing is the consequence of another because they happen together.</p>
        <p>People do it all the time.</p>

        <div class="row-fluid illustration">
          <div class="span6">
            <p>Sometimes, they don't do it on purpose, they just don't see the difference or make an error.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="span6">
            <p>Sometimes, they highlight correlation to falsely imply causation, which is simply dishonnest.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In any case, <strong>thinking that correlation implies causation is incorrect.</strong></p>
        <p>Let us be clear. Things <i>may</i> happen together because one is the consequence of the other. So, people are right when saying that correlation may be a hint of causation.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, one has to be careful and rigorous. A lot of things happen together, even though they do not cause each other. For example...</p>
        <div class="row-fluid illustration">
          <div class="span4">
            <p>A study showed that <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/07/10/kevin-rarely-gets-tres-bien/">for French kids, being named Kevin was correlated to getting poor grades in school</a>. Of course, your name does not have a direct effect on your grades. In that case, the correlation was caused by the two situations (the name and the grades) having a common source.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="span4">
            <p>See the comments under that <a href="http://www.money.cnn.com/infographic/technology/gates-ballmer-microsoft-stock/">graph showing the correlation between the person being CEO of Microsoft and the stock price</a> and the <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/08/in-defense-of-ballmer/">analysis here</a> for another example of a correlation not being a proof of causation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="span4">
            <p>Try to figure out if there is a causation effect, and if so, in what direction, in <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57598718/study-people-who-have-sex-four-or-more-times-a-week-make-more-money/">this article about the correlation between sexual activy and salary</a>.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>So what?</strong></p>

        <p>Wellâ€¦ just keep that in mind and learn to detect and point at fallicious arguments like the one discussed here. It will be useful on a daily basis:
          <ul class="illustration">
            <li>Making sound arguments (i.e. explaining real cause to effect, not relying only on correlation) will make you more credible.</li>
            <li>Having the ability to detect false reasoning will help you be a better critic of what you hear and read.</li>
            <li>Helping people around you understand the above will enrich them and provide you a warm, fuzzy feeling of doing the Right thing.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>Let people around you know when you hear a weak argument based on correlation. Be a constructive critic, and help us make the world a better place.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>
